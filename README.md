# Computer-Networks

## Final Project:
The goal of this project written in python, is to create a **simple chatroom** by first creating a pair of server and client which communicate via a certain port, and next implementing functions such as sending and displaying messages including sender's and recipent's(optional) names in a common environment acting as a chatroom.
